# final_project_bio316
This project looks to see the changes in striped bass and menhaden migrations along the East Coast via Latitude, Temperature, and Bathymetry. Data collected for this project came from MARSPEC and GBIF. 

The Data from MARSPEC was linked to files in Google Drive. Therefore, in order to gain access to these data rasters, it is imperative that the user has an active Google Drive account as well as download the "googledrive" R package. 

In addition to the "googledrive" package, libraries for ggplot2, raster, rgdal, dplyr, and spocc must also be called in. 

References on previous studies involving striped bass are referened at the end of the document for additional information.
